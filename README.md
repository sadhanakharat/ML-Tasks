## 1. 🔢 Find Missing Number in an Array
✨ **Problem:** Given a list containing `n` distinct numbers from `0` to `n`, find the missing number.

---

## 2. 🔄 Valid Parentheses Checker
✨ **Problem:** Check if a given string containing `()`, `{}`, `[]` is balanced.

---

## 3. 🔍 Find First Non-Repeating Character
✨ **Problem:** Given a string, return the first non-repeating character. If all characters repeat, return "None".

---

## 4. 📈 Longest Consecutive Sequence
✨ **Problem:** Given an unsorted list, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

---

## 5. 🔠 Group Anagrams
✨ **Problem:** Given a list of words, group the anagrams together.

---

## 6. 🎯 Find Kth Largest Element
✨ **Problem:** Find the `k`-th largest element in an unsorted list.

---

## 7. ✉️ Email Spam Classification
✨ **Problem:** Build a classification model to predict spam emails using the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/).

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Load dataset and preprocess emails.
2. Convert emails into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
3. Train **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models.
4. Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results.
5. Predict new emails.

---

## 8. 🖼️ MNIST Image Classification
✨ **Problem:** Classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hojjatk/mnist-dataset).

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Load MNIST dataset and preprocess images.
2. Train a **Neural Network (Fully Connected Layers)**.
3. Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results.
4. Predict new handwritten digits.
